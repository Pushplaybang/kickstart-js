# Tests

This folder should contain all the tests for your application. This app uses the [jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io/) from facebook.

## Tips:

- follow the folder structure of your src directory.
- tests must be named `[filename].test.js`.
- avoid testing framework code.
- use CI to run tests automatically before deployments or PR's.
- think of your tests as functional documentation.
- start with the most critical parts of your code.
- set test coverage expectations for your project and team.
- use the test coverage html reports for non-dev stakeholders.
